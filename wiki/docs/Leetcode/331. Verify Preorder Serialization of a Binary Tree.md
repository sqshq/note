One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as `#`.

```
     _9_
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6
/ \ / \   / \
# # # #   # #
```

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string `"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"`, where `#` represents a null node.

Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character` '#'` representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as `"1,,3"`.

Example 1:

```
Input: "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "1,#"
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "9,#,#,1"
Output: false
```


#### Solution 1

Some used stack. Some used the depth of a stack. Here I use a different perspective. In a binary tree, if we consider null as leaves, then

* all non-null node provides 2 outdegree and 1 indegree (2 children and 1 parent), except root
* all null node provides 0 outdegree and 1 indegree (0 child and 1 parent).

Suppose we try to build this tree. During building, we record the difference between out degree and in degree `diff` = `outdegree - indegree`. When the next node comes, we then decrease `diff` by 1, because the node provides an in degree. If the node is not null, we increase `diff` by 2, because it provides two out degrees. If a serialization is correct, `diff` should never be negative and `diff` will be zero when finished.

为什么开始为1呢？其实可以这么理解，在根结点上加一个虚拟的根节点。

```Java
public boolean isValidSerialization(String preorder) {
    String[] nodes = preorder.split(",");
    int diff = 1;
    for (String node: nodes) {
        if (--diff < 0) return false;
        if (!node.equals("#")) diff += 2;
    }
    return diff == 0;
}
```


#### Solution2

```Java
 public boolean isValidSerialization(String preorder) {
    // using a stack, scan left to right
    // case 1: we see a number, just push it to the stack
    // case 2: we see #, check if the top of stack is also #
    // if so, pop #, pop the number in a while loop, until top of stack is not #
    // if not, push it to stack
    // in the end, check if stack size is 1, and stack top is #
    if (preorder == null) {
        return false;
    }
    Stack<String> st = new Stack<>();
    String[] strs = preorder.split(",");
    for (int pos = 0; pos < strs.length; pos++) {
        String curr = strs[pos];
        while (curr.equals("#") && !st.isEmpty() && st.peek().equals(curr)) {
            st.pop();
            if (st.isEmpty()) {
                return false;
            }
            st.pop();
        }
        st.push(curr);
    }
    return st.size() == 1 && st.peek().equals("#");
}
```
